# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is one of the biggest concerns for financial institutions and cardholders worldwide. 
Fraudsters use various techniques to obtain personal information and use it to make unauthorized purchases, 
which can result in significant financial losses. In this context, credit card fraud detection systems have 
become an essential tool for financial institutions to prevent fraud and protect their customers.

In this project, we have developed a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. 
The system is designed to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing various transactional attributes 
such as transaction amount, time, location, etc. The project was implemented using Python and various libraries 
such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

The dataset used for this project is publicly available from Kaggle. It contains a total of 284,807 transactions, 
out of which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset was preprocessed, and the features were scaled to ensure that the machine
learning models could perform optimally. The preprocessed data was then split into training and testing datasets, with a ratio of 70:30.

We tested several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. 
After training and testing the models, we found that the random forest algorithm performed the best, with an accuracy of 99.92%, precision 
of 98.60%, and recall of 88.51%.

The random forest algorithm works by constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions. The algorithm is effective in 
handling large datasets with high-dimensional features, making it suitable for credit card fraud detection. The algorithm's performance is 
further improved by tuning the hyperparameters, such as the number of trees and the maximum depth of the trees.

The credit card fraud detection system developed in this project can be integrated into financial institutions' existing systems to monitor 
transactions in real-time. The system can automatically flag transactions that are likely to be fraudulent, allowing institutions to take 
quick action to prevent losses. The system can also be used to improve customer experience by reducing false positives, ensuring that 
legitimate transactions are not mistakenly flagged as fraudulent.

In conclusion, credit card fraud is a growing concern for financial institutions, and machine learning algorithms can be effective in
detecting fraudulent transactions. In this project, we developed a credit card fraud detection system using the random forest algorithm, 
which achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall. The system can be integrated into existing financial systems to improve fraud detection
and protect customers from financial losses.
